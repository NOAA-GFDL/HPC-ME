# spack environment config to generate a dockerfile for the fre-cli CI image. 
# Images should be tagged with gcc version used
# 1. download spack and source a setup script from spack/share
# 2. cd into this directory
# 3. `spack -e ./ containerize > Dockerfile`
# 4. The generated dockerfile for this will need a slight modification when it strips the
#    binaries since it gets snagged on miniconda's test directories, you'll need to add something like
#    --exclude-dir=/opt/software/linux-rocky9-zen2/gcc-11.4.1/miniconda3-*/pkgs/packaging-24.1-py312h06a4308_0/info/test/tests/
#    to the grep command that gets piped into strip. The exact path will change based on whats installed.
